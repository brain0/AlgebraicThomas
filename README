    README file for the `AlgebraicThomas' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    AlgebraicThomas-x.x.tar.gz
    AlgebraicThomas-x.x.zoo
    AlgebraicThomas-x.x.tar.bz2
    AlgebraicThomas-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    gunzip AlgebraicThomas-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf AlgebraicThomas-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzoo -x AlgebraicThomas-x.x.zoo
and so on.

(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `AlgebraicThomas'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command `gap makedoc.g'
in the AlgebraicThomas directory. But this should not be necessary.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
